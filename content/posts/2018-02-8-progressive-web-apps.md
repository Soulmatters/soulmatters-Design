**Progressive Web Applications** (PWA) have been able to bring online users to the standards that will revolutionize the entire Web by introducing new features. Websites will be as good or even better as native mobile apps.

It is characterized by the fact that it allows offline loading of the site, offers animations at 60 fps, easy browsing and instant loading like native applications.

Also, as we are many users using smartphones, tablets, through** Progressive Web App **we can be closer to our favorite sites. This means that when we visiting a site and stay longer than 5 minutes, we will receive a notification asking if we want to add the web application icon to the Home screen of the mobile device.

Let's talk a little about** Push Notification**, a component that improves user experience in online and can contribute also in a good way for small or big business.

On the desktop and your phone screen, there will be notifications about the activity of the platforms where you chose to receive updates (e.g., FB notifications, G + that appear at the bottom right of the screen). Thus you will always be in touch with what you are interested in.

Push Notification has increased the sales of many sites. An example would be: https://www.jumia.com.ng After implementing web notifications, the site had 38% more users back in, even after abandoning the Shopping Cart. The site sold 9 times more than sending out emails to users to let them know about the incomplete order yet.

The user is always notified in real time on his desktop/mobile device about the activity of his favorite site. Practically, **Push Notification** is a very necessary online component. The main reasons is to evolve, let people to gain access to new perspectives especially in business.

The **Service worker** is hopeful to upload the main elements of the site so that the user can already enjoy the experience of the page he is visiting. Once the site remains cached, its loading is instantaneous, right from the first second of access.

**Appshell** contains the essential elements of a web application, such as the common CSS file, the menu and certain Javascript, which are related to the functionality of the essential elements of the site's design. It's actually like a frame of the site to be visited. With the help of the Service Worker, the first data will be loaded and stored in Cache, contributing to a quick access to the following pages.

**Security** - With the** SSL certificate**. You have the security of your data, the safe experience of site's visitors and and the evolution of your online business. We all want a safer and faster online environment!

In conclusion, for Progressive Web App, we conclude:

**Push** - Reduce HTTP / 2 data transfer time;

**Render** - fast page rendering

**Pre-Load** - loading essential code items that already allow the use of the web page;

**Lazy-Load **- uploading the codes, content, images to be accessed when navigating and other pages from the site;
