**HTTP/2** and **HTTPS** - the speed and security of your online experience





Comparative Analysis of HTTP and **HTTP/2**



**HTTP/2** compared with HTTP shows a noticeable improvement in site loading speed and efficient data compression.



**HTTP/2** allows the server to send packages of data to the browser before it requests them. The request reloading cycle will not be resumed every time, and so the access to the site is faster.



Currently, **HTTP/2** has partial support on IE11, limited to Windows 10 and Safari limited to OSX 10.11x. However, the most used Chrome browsers, Firefox, Opera, Amazon Silk support **HTTP/2 **and that's the most important.



Unlike HTTP, **HTTP/2 **makes sites load on segments without reducing their functionality. The server will also provide the data browser as quickly as possible so the user can immediately access the desired page.





**SECURITY**



**HTTP/2** can't function without **HTTPS**



Without having an** SSL** security certificate, **HTTP/2** doesn't work.

The **HTTPS **connection on a site - a green locks appears in the address bar of your browser.



**HTTPS** focuses on the following 3 aspects:



**IDENTITY** - you know who you are "talking" to, people will know that your site is real and will feel safe navigating it.

**CONFIDENTIALITY** - Only the browser and the server will be able to read the site's data.

**INTEGRITY **- Your data will be safe without anyone being able to modify it. For example, there will be no problems with unwanted ads. Although in your personal browser it seems to be all right on the computers of others, without an** SSL**, all it can be full of ads and various messages.



Without a secure connection, there may be trouble displaying the location. Your site may display a wrong location. Through **HTTPS**, the browser and the server will know exactly where the correct location is: what one receives, the other one will receive also.



Choose the safest and fastest way for easy browsing online!





HTTP can not work well on a newer and more complex site. That is why **HTTP/2** improves the user experience online and it is desirable for more and more people to be informed about this!
