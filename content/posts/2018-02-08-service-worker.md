Service Worker belongs to Progressive Web Applications and it is a script running in the browser in the background. 



Service Worker includes: Push Notification, background sync, and the ability to access a site you have navigated in the past even when you are offline. A site that you can access even if you are disconnected from the Internet.  Service Worker was designed for locations with a poor connectivity to Internet, but this has lots of advantages for regular users and business owners as well.



Service Worker lets you run pages in your browser's cache to access the content you want.



Synchronization in the background provided by Service Worker allows you to write a message to a site even if you are offline with the certainty that it will be sent. 



As you are offline, the message stays in the background. When you reconnect to the Internet, the message will be delivered.



Also, take notice: Service Worker does not run without a security certificate. For an offline loading SSL is essential!



The web pages you want to access and which have Service Worker, can be accessed even offline. Advantages: If your a customer, you can stay tunned with favourites sites. If you have a business, your sales will be above competitors. Clients which visited your site in the past, can find you. Even when they can't connect to the Internet in that very moment!
