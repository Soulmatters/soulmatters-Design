validity of 90 days but with the possibility to manually renew the certificates 30 days before it expires.



Collaboration



Mozilla Corporation, Cisco Systems, Inc., Akamai Technologies, Electronic Frontier Foundation, IdenTrust, Inc., University of Michigan researchers and many others work together through the Internet Security Research Group (ISRG).



ISRG is a California corporation that works for the benefit of the Internet, optimizing and securing the online environment.



On the CA side, the possibility of detecting and protecting antimalware and antipishing is limited. This is due to the fact that it does not have sufficient visibility on the content on the Internet. Why? Viruses can affect certain pages and can quickly change their target.



They can get into the breaches due to the expiration of the security certificate. Also, the site is vulnerable while running the certificate renewal procedure. That's why we better update it before it expires, maybe even daily if we have the time. Currently, CA only has a blacklist of problematic sites.



There are many people in bad faith who buy SSL from various certified authorities, then enter people's sites and create damages. However, most browsers still develop ways to prevent data theft and anti-malware.



Letsencrypt.org is an open-source platform on which the continuity of the road depends on issuing free SSL certificates. Let's hope there will be other platforms with the same goal, which will help to make the Internet safer.
